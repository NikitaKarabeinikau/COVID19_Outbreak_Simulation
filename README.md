# COVID-19_Outbreak_Simulation

Computer simulation of COVID-19 outbreak, which is based on the deterministic
differential equation model, complicated version of the SEIR-model. This model is
calculated for each country separately when it becomes infected. A separate
algorithm simulates border crossings using data from csv-files and identifies
infected countries.
This simulation has a web interface written with Django framework.
